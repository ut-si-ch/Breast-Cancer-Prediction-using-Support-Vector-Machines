## ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### ðŸ§© Overview

This project applies **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithms to classify tumors as **benign or malignant**, based on patient data. Leveraging real-world datasets, it demonstrates the power of SVM in binary classification problems with high dimensionality and medical relevance.

### ðŸ“Š Data Understanding

* **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`)
* **Size**: 569 samples Ã— 30 features
* **Target Variable**: `target` â€“ 1 (benign), 0 (malignant)
* **Features**:

  * Cell nucleus characteristics: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
* **Data Characteristics**:

  * No missing values
  * Highly imbalanced classes handled naturally by SVM margin maximization
